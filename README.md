# Lung Cancer Detection with CNN

## Overview

This project focuses on lung cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It leverages a dataset of high-resolution lung scans provided by the National Cancer Institute. The goal is to develop accurate algorithms that can identify cancerous lesions in lung scans, reducing false positives, enabling early interventions, and providing more time for radiologists to engage with patients.

## Dataset Details

The dataset consists of thousands of low-dose CT images in DICOM format, primarily from high-risk patients. Each image comprises a series of axial slices of the chest cavity, with varying 2D slices. The DICOM files contain patient information and scan parameters, including slice thickness.

## Task

The primary objective is to create an automated method capable of predicting whether a patient will be diagnosed with lung cancer within one year of the scan date. Ground truth labels are confirmed through pathology diagnosis.

## Data Challenges

The dataset includes scans from various sources, resulting in varying image quality. Older scans may have lower quality due to less sophisticated equipment, while more recent data (stage 2) tends to have higher quality with thinner slice thickness. The algorithm should perform effectively across a range of image qualities.

Please note that data for this competition is no longer available for download due to usage restrictions.
